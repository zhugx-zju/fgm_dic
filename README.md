# FGM ASM Solver

## Two-end traction research branch

`force_bilateral_traction` starts from `main` and models the central
`110 mm x 20 mm` parallel section of the dogbone specimen in plane stress.
The left and right faces receive equal, opposite, uniform axial tractions
`-q e_x` and `+q e_x`, with `q = F_TOT / (GEO_H * THICKNESS)`.
`F_TOT` is the measured tensile force at **each** end, not the sum of both
nodal force vectors. The model is assembled per unit thickness. The top and
bottom faces are traction free. Only three DOFs are pinned to remove rigid
translation and rotation; neither end is clamped.

Run `python -m script.forward_job` before `python -m script.inverse_main` or
`python -m script.inverse_l_curve`. The inverse scripts reuse the saved force
vector and three-DOF gauge from the forward run, and reject forward data from
a different loading mode. Output folders include `_TwoEnd_T<thickness>` to
keep this branch's results separate from `main`.

The default `0.01 N` load and linearly increasing synthetic `E(x)` field are a
numerical smoke case. `EY = 1.0` sets the y gradient of the forward field to
zero. The inverse optimizer still assigns an independent modulus to every 2D
mesh node; no x-only constraint or transverse averaging enters its objective.
The inverse outputs a separate `x_profile_reconstruction` plot and reports
both error of the y-mean profile and variation across y. Set measured force
and independently calibrated modulus values before interpreting a physical
experiment. DIC displacements must be registered to
the same rigid-body gauge before inversion. The seven infill zones, DIC point
mapping, specimen shoulder effects, and the validity of uniform end traction
are not yet represented by this rectangular numerical model.

Validated on a small mesh with equal/opposite edge resultants, the analytical
uniform-stress solution, zero gauge reactions, and a finite-difference check
of the adjoint modulus gradient. Run `python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`
to repeat those checks.

This repository contains a small finite element codebase for forward and inverse analysis of 2D functionally graded materials (FGMs) under plane-stress assumptions.

The project covers:

- structured quadrilateral mesh generation
- forward displacement analysis
- modulus-field reconstruction from displacement data
- Tikhonov regularization and gradient checking
- L-curve based regularization-parameter selection
- plotting and export utilities for saved results

## Branch Strategy

This repository is managed as a research codebase with one stable baseline branch and independent exploratory branches.

- `main`: baseline branch for the current small-strain, linear-elastic, force-controlled workflow
- `force_bilateral_traction`: two-end uniform traction on the cropped parallel section
- `disp_linear`: displacement-controlled branch under small-strain linear elasticity
- `disp_nonlinear`: displacement-controlled branch for finite-strain and nonlinear constitutive development

The intended workflow is:

- keep `main` stable and easy to rerun
- let each research branch evolve independently
- only bring clearly reusable fixes or utilities back to `main`

See [docs/branch_scope.md](docs/branch_scope.md) for the lightweight branch rules and [docs/validation.md](docs/validation.md) for the validation-record template.

## Model Summary

- Geometry: rectangular 2D domain
- Elements: 4-node bilinear quadrilateral elements
- Integration: 2x2 Gauss quadrature
- Material field: nodal Young's modulus with bilinear, exponential, or Gaussian random-field variation
- Boundary conditions on this branch: opposite uniform traction on both x ends; three rigid-body gauge DOFs
- Inverse objective: displacement misfit plus Tikhonov smoothness regularization on the modulus field

## Dependencies

Install the Python dependencies with:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Current required packages:

- `numpy>=1.21.0`
- `scipy>=1.7.0`
- `matplotlib>=3.4.0`

## Current Default Configuration

The main defaults are defined in `config.py`, which now returns typed configuration objects:

- geometry: `110.0 x 20.0 mm`, thickness `3.2 mm`
- mesh: `55 x 10`
- tensile force at each end: `0.01 N` (numerical demonstration)
- Poisson ratio: `0.3`
- modulus targets: `Ex = 2.0`, `Ey = 1.0` (synthetic truth depends on x only)
- distribution type: `bil`
- GRF defaults (used when `DIS_TYPE = 'grf'`): `E_max = 8.0`, `sigma_g = 1.0`, `ell = 25.0 mm`, `seed = 42`
- default regularization parameter: `1e-6`

## Typical Workflow

1. Edit `config.py` if you want to change geometry, mesh density, material distribution, or inverse settings.
2. Run the forward problem:

```bash
python -m script.forward_job
```

3. Run one of the inverse workflows:

Recommended, because it includes automatic gamma selection and a final independent rerun with the selected `gamma`:

```bash
python -m script.inverse_l_curve
```

Alternative single-gamma L-BFGS-B workflow:

```bash
python -m script.inverse_main
```

4. Regenerate plots from saved result files if needed:

```bash
python -m script.plot_forward_results
python -m script.plot_inverse_results
python -m script.plot_lcurve
```

## Output Files

The main forward and inverse workflows continue to write generated case folders
to the repository root. These outputs remain ignored by Git.

The scripts save results into a folder named like:

```text
Geo_110x20_Mesh_55x10_Alpha_0.0091_Beta_0.0000_Gamma_1e-06_TwoEnd_T3.2
```

Inverse-result files are now organized in a noise-specific subfolder, for example:

```text
Geo_110x20_Mesh_55x10_Alpha_0.0091_Beta_0.0000_Gamma_1e-06_TwoEnd_T3.2/
|-- noise_0.00pct/
|   |-- inverse_results.pkl
|   |-- lcurve_analysis.pkl
|   |-- reconstruction_results.png
|   |-- x_profile_reconstruction.png
|   |-- iteration_history.png
|   |-- gradient_field.png
|   |-- reconstruction_comparison.png
|   |-- lcurve.png
|   `-- curvature_vs_gamma.png
```

Typical generated files include:

- `forward_problem_data.pkl`
- `forward_results.png`
- `forward_results.pdf`
- `noise_XX.XXpct/inverse_results.pkl`
- `noise_XX.XXpct/lcurve_analysis.pkl`
- `noise_XX.XXpct/reconstruction_results.png`
- `noise_XX.XXpct/x_profile_reconstruction.png` and `.pdf`
- `noise_XX.XXpct/iteration_history.png`
- `noise_XX.XXpct/gradient_field.png`
- `noise_XX.XXpct/reconstruction_comparison.png`
- additional exported figures from the plotting scripts

Most plotting utilities automatically search for the most recently modified result folder that matches the `Geo_*_Mesh_*_Alpha_*_Beta_*_Gamma_*` pattern.

The entry points resolve the repository root from their own location, so they
write and search the same root-level case folders even when launched with
`python -m script.<module>`.

## Forward Problem

`script/forward_job.py` performs the following steps:

1. reads the forward configuration from `config.py`
2. creates a structured rectangular mesh
3. generates the FGM modulus field
4. applies the boundary conditions from `fgm_asm.mesh.setup_boundary_conditions`
5. assembles the FE system and solves for displacement
6. saves the results as a pickle file
7. exports forward-result figures

Set `DIS_TYPE = 'grf'` in `config.py` to use the Gaussian random-field material
generator. The Python implementation follows `GRF_Generate.m`: it uses a
squared-exponential RBF covariance, `tanh` normalization to `[0, E_max]`, and
a reproducible seed. Because ASM uses a tensor-product rectangular mesh, the
RBF covariance is sampled through separable one-dimensional Cholesky factors;
this avoids constructing the dense pairwise covariance matrix used by the
reference MATLAB implementation and keeps fine meshes practical.

The public API generates one case at a time:

```python
from fgm_asm import generate_grf_field

E_field = generate_grf_field(
    mesh_info,
    E_max=8.0,
    sigma_g=1.0,
    ell=1.0,
    seed=42,
)
```

## Inverse Problem Options

### `script/inverse_l_curve.py`

This is the most complete end-to-end inverse workflow in the current repository:

- loads the latest forward result set
- assembles the mass matrix
- uses a single configured noise level per run
- sweeps `gamma` values on a log scale
- runs warm-started SciPy L-BFGS-B solves
- selects the best `gamma` using maximum L-curve curvature
- reruns the inverse problem from the default initialization with the selected `gamma`
- saves both the L-curve scan data and the final rerun result
- stores the scan-optimal solution inside `inverse_results.pkl` so it can be compared with the final rerun

### `script/inverse_main.py`

This script uses the same SciPy L-BFGS-B implementation as the L-curve workflow, but with a fixed user-specified `gamma`.

It saves each noise case into its own `noise_XX.XXpct` subdirectory. The current repository is still more polished around the L-curve workflow, so `inverse_l_curve.py` remains the safer default entry point.

## Plotting

`script/plot_inverse_results.py` now generates:

- the final rerun reconstruction figure
- iteration-history plots for the final rerun
- gradient-field plots for the final rerun
- a comparison figure between the L-curve scan optimum and the final rerun with the selected `gamma`

The comparison plot is useful when you want to see whether warm-start continuation during the L-curve sweep materially changes the selected solution compared with a clean rerun from the default initialization.

## Notes

- The codebase now separates concerns more explicitly.
- `config.py` defines typed runtime configuration objects.
- `results_io.py` owns result-file naming, directory layout, and pickle persistence.
- `workflows.py` owns shared top-level script loading logic.
- `visualization.py` is the single plotting module for reusable plot helpers and script-facing visualization entry points.
- `mesh.py` now precomputes geometry-only quadrature data once per mesh and assembles the regularization matrix once for reuse.
- `fem_forward.py` reuses one stiffness factorization for both forward and adjoint solves inside the same inverse-state evaluation.
- `inverse_solver.py` uses one cached L-BFGS-B evaluation path and avoids duplicate forward solves in callbacks and L-curve post-processing.
- `setup_boundary_conditions` now lives in `fgm_asm/mesh.py`.
- `script/forward_job.py` saves figures without blocking on an interactive Matplotlib window.
- `script/inverse_l_curve.py` processes one noise value per run. If `config.py` provides multiple values, the script currently uses the first one.
- Plotting scripts rely on saved pickle files rather than rerunning the solver.
- Result files are stored as Python pickle objects, which is convenient for internal reuse but not intended as a stable interchange format.
- For research branching, keep each branch's scope, output layout, and validation notes documented even if the code stays largely independent.
